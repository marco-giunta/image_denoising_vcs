# Image denoising of highly obfuscated human faces (vcs exam)
 Convolutional AutoEncoder-based networks to denoise images of obfuscated human faces
 
This repository is a messy archives of all the code written by Luca Rinaldi and me for the Vision & Cognitive Systems exam; the most important and readable file is probably `cv2.ipynb`. We developed a convolutional autoencoder to denoised blurred and pixelated faces from the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset, then tried to modify it by adding variational blocks, residual blocks, and by using the perceptual loss (alone or in linear combination with the pixel/mse loss). The results in a tidy format are presented in the PDF report and presentation, so I suggest checking those out.
